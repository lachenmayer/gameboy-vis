# gameboy-vis

Inspired by the [Ultimate Game Boy Talk at 33c3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyzD8pNlpwI), I wrote this to read a GameBoy ROM and visualize it using the tile format the console uses for sprites & backgrounds.

This currently does not have a usable interface - if you're interested, give me a shout.
